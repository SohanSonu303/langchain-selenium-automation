Excellent question. This gets to the heart of how to best leverage the intelligence you've built into your agent. Based on the rules in your system prompt and the tools you've created, you can interact with your agent in several ways, moving from highly explicit instructions to pure natural language.

Let's break down the best-case scenarios for user queries, from good to best, using your Microsoft.com example.

---

### Tier 1: The "Hybrid" Approach (Good, but verbose)

This is what you're currently doing. It mixes natural language with explicit selectors.

*   **How it works:** You're telling the agent *what* to do and also *exactly how* to find the element using a specific XPath or CSS selector. This primarily triggers **Rule A (Direct Selector)**.
*   **Example Query (Your Current Style):**
    ```json
    {
      "query": "Open 'https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/', then click 'All Microsoft' xpath is '//*[@id='uhf-c-nav']/ul/li/div/button'. ... type 'newuser101' into input css selector is '#i0116'. then close browser"
    }
    ```
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Maximum Precision:** The agent will not make a mistake in finding the element, as long as the selector is correct.
    *   **Good for Debugging:** It's useful when you need to force a specific action on a known element.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Brittle:** If Microsoft changes the XPath or CSS selector on their website, the automation will break.
    *   **High User Effort:** You have to manually inspect the page and get the selectors.
    *   **Not truly "NLP":** It's more like a command script written in English.

### Tier 2: The "Context-Aware" Approach (Better - The Sweet Spot)

This approach fully leverages your `context_filename` feature. You speak in natural language, using descriptions that you know are present in the `azure_action_annotated.json` file. This triggers **Rule B (Contextual Search)**.

*   **How it works:** The agent will match your descriptions ("All Microsoft", "Microsoft Cloud") to the `selector` or `value` fields within the JSON file and use the pre-recorded, reliable `xpath`.
*   **Example Query (Recommended for your setup):**
    ```json
    {
      "query": "Go to microsoft.com for India. From the navigation, click the 'All Microsoft' button. In the menu that appears, click 'Microsoft Cloud', then 'Products', then 'Azure'. On the next page, click 'Sign in'. Finally, type 'newuser101' into the email address field and close the browser.",
      "context_filename": "azure_action_annotated.json"
    }
    ```
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Robust & Efficient:** You're using natural language, but the agent uses pre-verified selectors from your context file, which is fast and reliable.
    *   **User-Friendly:** The queries are easy to write and read, as they describe a user's journey.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Requires a Context File:** This approach only works for actions and elements you have pre-recorded.

### Tier 3: The "Pure NLP" Approach (Best - Fully Agentic)

This is the ultimate goal of an agentic system. You provide a high-level goal with descriptive, human-like instructions, and you trust the agent's `find_interactive_element` tool to figure it out. This primarily triggers **Rule D (General Search)**.

*   **How it works:** The agent uses its intelligent scoring algorithm within `find_interactive_element` to find the most relevant interactive element on the page that matches your description. No context file is needed.
*   **Example Query (The most flexible):**
    ```json
    {
      "query": "Navigate to the Indian Microsoft website. Find the 'All Microsoft' button in the header and click it. A menu should open; from that menu, click on the 'Microsoft Cloud' link. Then click on the main 'Products' link. Next, find and click the button for 'Azure'. On the Azure page, click the sign-in button. When the login form appears, enter 'newuser101' into the username or email field. When you are done, close the browser."
    }
    ```
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Extremely Flexible:** Requires no setup (like creating a context file). It can adapt to pages it has never seen before.
    *   **Resilient to UI Changes:** If a button's XPath changes but its text remains "Azure", the agent will still find it.
    *   **Truly Conversational:** You can instruct it just like you would a person.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Potential Ambiguity:** On a complex page with multiple "Details" buttons, the agent might need a more specific query (e.g., "the 'Details' button for the Surface Pro").
    *   **Slightly Slower:** It involves executing JavaScript on the page to find and score elements, which can be a fraction of a second slower than using a direct selector.

### Advanced & Specialized Queries

You can also craft queries to specifically test your new, more advanced tools:

*   **Chained Actions (Verify then Act):**
    ```json
    {
      "query": "On the Azure homepage, find the main banner. Verify it contains the text 'Build your vision', and if it does, click that banner."
    }
    ```
    This query specifically tests the agent's ability to use the `locator` returned from the `verify_text_on_element` tool for its next action.

*   **Scoped/Relative Searches:**
    ```json
    {
      "query": "On the Microsoft homepage, find the main footer section at the bottom. Inside that footer, find and click the 'Privacy' link."
    }
    ```    This encourages the agent to first find the "footer section" and then use its XPath as the `container_xpath` for a scoped search, triggering **Rule C**.

### Summary Table

| Query Type | Primary Rule Used | Pros | Cons | Best For... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hybrid** | `A (Direct Selector)` | Precise, predictable. | Brittle, high user effort. | Pinpoint debugging, simple scripts. |
| **Context-Aware** | `B (Contextual Search)` | Robust, efficient, natural. | Requires a pre-recorded JSON file. | **Reliable, repeatable automation of known user flows.** |
| **Pure NLP** | `D (General Search)` | Flexible, resilient, conversational. | Can be ambiguous, slightly slower. | **Exploring new websites or when UI is expected to change.** |
| **Advanced** | `C`, `Verify-then-Act` | Powerful, precise control flow. | Requires more complex phrasing. | Testing complex interactions and relative element finding. |

**Conclusion:** For your current setup, the **"Context-Aware" (Tier 2)** approach is the ideal balance of reliability and user-friendliness. You should aim to write queries like that. The **"Pure NLP" (Tier 3)** approach is what you should use when you don't have a context file or want to test the agent's raw intelligence.
